# Sudoko
# Description
The Java Sudoku Game is a console-based implementation of the classic Sudoku puzzle. It provides an interactive platform where players can solve Sudoku grids, test their logical reasoning skills, and enjoy a challenging gaming experience.

# Features:
Sudoku Grid Generation: The game generates random Sudoku grids of varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) each time it starts or when requested by the player.
Console Interface: The game provides a user-friendly console interface where players can input their guesses and navigate the Sudoku grid easily.
Input Validation: The application validates user input to ensure that only valid numbers (1 to 9) are accepted in empty cells.
Hint System: If players get stuck, they can request hints to receive a correct number for a particular cell. However, using hints might reduce the final score.
Save and Load: Players can save the current state of the Sudoku puzzle and resume their game later from where they left off.
Timer: A timer feature keeps track of the time taken to solve the puzzle, encouraging players to challenge themselves for better completion times.
Win Condition: Once the player fills all cells correctly and completes the Sudoku grid, the game congratulates the player and displays their final completion time.
